### Diff between subsequence and sub string.
    Substring is continuous string of characters.
    Whereas subsequence need not be continuous but still
    order will be same.
### For a string having length n
    It can have 2^n possible subsequence
    example: s = "AB", n = 2
    We can have 2^n that is 2^2 subsequences.
    Like, "", "A", "B", "AB"
