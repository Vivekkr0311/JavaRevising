### Diff between subsequence and sub string.
    Substring is continuous string of characters.
    Whereas subsequence need not be continuous but still
    order will be same.
### For a string having length n
    It can have 2^n possible subsequence
    example: s = "AB", n = 2
    We can have 2^n that is 2^2 subsequences.
    Like, "", "A", "B", "AB"

### Variations of LCS
    1. Diff utility
    2. Minium insertion and deletion needed to convert s1 into s2
    3. Shortest Common Subsequence
    4. Longest Palingdrome Subsequence
    5. Longest Repeating Subsequence
    6. Space optimized DP solution of LCS
    7. Printing LCS
