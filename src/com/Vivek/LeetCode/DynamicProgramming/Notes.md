### What is Dynamic Programing ?
    In Simple words, it (Dynamic Programing) is an optimization over plain recursion.
### How does it work ?
    The idea of Dynamic Programing is to reuse the solutions of sub problems there are over lapping problems.

## There are two ways to write Dynamic Programing program.
    1. Tabulation: Bottom up approach
    2. Memoization: Top down approach

## Applications of Dynamic Programing
    1. Bellmen ford Algorithm
    2. Floyd Warshall Algorithm
    3. Diff utility (LCS)
    4. Search Closed Words (Edit Distance)
    5. Resource Allocation (0-1 Knapsack)
    ... so on
