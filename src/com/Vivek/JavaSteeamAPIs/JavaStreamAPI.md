# Java Stream API
```
We convert a collections into a stream, then we can apply functional and declarative approach to
operate on that stream. This is all about Java Steam APIs.
Declarative approach means, you just write code for what you want to do, not how you will do.
```
## Benifits
### Readability:
```Streams provide a more readable and expressive way to perform operations on collections. The syntax is concise and easy to understand, making it easier for other developers to read and maintain your code. ```

### Flexibility: 
``` Streams allow you to perform a variety of operations on collections, such as filtering, mapping, and reducing, without having to write multiple loops or methods. This can save time and make your code more flexible.```
### Parallelism: 
```Streams can be processed in parallel, which can provide a significant performance boost for large collections. With a for loop, you would have to write your own multi-threaded code to achieve parallelism. ```
### Encapsulation: 
``` Streams encourage encapsulation, as you can perform a series of operations on a collection without modifying the original data. This can help prevent bugs and improve code reliability. ```
