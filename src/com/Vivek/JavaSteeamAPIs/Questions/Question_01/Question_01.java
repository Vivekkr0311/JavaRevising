/**
 *
 * Hereâ€™s a coding question to practice Java Streams:
 * Problem:
 * You are given a list of employees, where each employee has the following attributes:
 * id, name, department, and salary.
 * Write code using Java Streams to solve the following:
 * Find the average salary of employees in the "IT" department.
 * Get a list of names of employees whose salary is greater than 50,000.
 * Group the employees by their department.
 * Find the employee with the highest salary.
 * Count the number of employees in each department.
